Rival Chess for Windows
=======================

This is the Windows update of the original DOS-based Rival chess engine.

Written using the Borland C++ IDE and the Borlands Object Windows Library.

Originally developed for Windows 3.1 around 1995/96 as part of my final-year computer science dissertation discussing how an object-oriented programming approach could be applied to the development of a chess program.
